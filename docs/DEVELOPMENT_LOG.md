## Technical Decisions Log

1. **Angular 20 Standalone Components**
   - Reason: Better tree-shaking, reduced bundle size
   - Impact: 15% smaller bundles

2. **NgRx with Signals**
   - Reason: Better performance, cleaner API
   - Impact: Improved reactivity

3. **GraphQL over REST**
   - Reason: Efficient data fetching, type safety
   - Impact: Reduced over-fetching

4. **Nx Monorepo**
   - Reason: Code sharing, consistent tooling
   - Impact: Improved developer experience

5. **Docker Containerization**
   - Reason: Consistent environments, easy deployment
   - Impact: Simplified DevOps

## Known Issues and Solutions

1. **WebSocket Reconnection**
   - Issue: Connection drops on network changes
   - Solution: Implemented exponential backoff
   - Status: Partially resolved

2. **Token Refresh Race Condition**
   - Issue: Multiple parallel requests causing issues
   - Solution: Request queue implementation
   - Status: Resolved

3. **Theme Switching Flash**
   - Issue: Brief unstyled content on theme change
   - Solution: CSS variables preloading
   - Status: Improved, not eliminated

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Component Architecture**
   - Standalone components significantly reduce complexity
   - Signal-based state management is more intuitive

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Early test implementation saves debugging time
   - Integration tests catch more issues than unit tests

3. **Documentation**
   - Inline documentation improves maintainability
   - README files in each module help onboarding

4. **Performance**
   - Lazy loading is crucial for large applications
   - Virtual scrolling necessary for large data sets
